Our data comes from the Health Care Systems Research Network (HCSRN) Virtual Data Warehouse (VDW.)  For more information, see: http://www.hcsrn.org/en/About/Data/wysiwyg.html

This repository contains:
* documentation about our data: Description of MHRN VDW Data.doc, MHRN_DataDictionary2011.doc

* our definition of mental health specialty and psychotherapy procedure codes: MHRN_psychotherapyList.xls.  A few new codes were introduced and others retired at the beginning of 2013.  We keep all these codes in the file, so it is backward-compatible.

* medications we study: GenericDrugNames_2021.xls, an annually-updated SAS dataset containing the NDCs for these drugs (mhrn3_ndc2021.zip) and some sample code for generating this dataset (UpdateMHRx_NDC_send2.sas)

* Procedure codes: MHRN_pxcodes_new.xls and sas7bdat.  Be sure to restrict to the category you want!
