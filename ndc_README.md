Read me for MHRN2_ndc2016, 2017 plus 2018 (NO CHANGES in 2018)

ALWAYS review Category and Active_ingredient (cleaned version of generic name) to make sure this list is appropriate for your use.

A human-readable summary of included drugs is available in this repository: GenericDrugNames_[YEAR].xls

New in 2016 (version "c"): 

* NDC flagged as re-used are deleted if their obsolete_date is in the past
* Injectable antipsychotics organized as a separate class
* A subset of injectable antipsychotics are flagged by the LAI variable (1=long-acting, 0=short-acting)
* Subclass variable added, populated for antidepressants only

New in 2017:
Note: injectables other than antipsychotics are included in their regular class. (e.g. benzodiazepines and anticonvulsants.)  Refer to variables Route and Dosage_form if you want to exclude these.
However, these are unlikely to appear in outpatient pharmacy records.
